# Japanese-Character-Recognition

### Project Overview:
This project centers around the development and evaluation of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the precise recognition of Japanese characters. The primary focus is on comparing the performance of these two architectures in the context of character recognition, leveraging the KMNIST datasetâ€”a specialized variation derived from the MNIST challenge. The dataset comprises 10 distinct characters from the Kuzushiji alphabet, providing a unique and challenging task for the models.

### Dataset:
The KMNIST dataset, a nuanced adaptation of the MNIST challenge, serves as the cornerstone of this project. With 10 Japanese characters carefully selected from the Kuzushiji alphabet, this dataset presents a diverse and culturally significant collection. Each character is associated with specific class labels, forming the basis for training and evaluating the DNN and CNN models.

### Model Architecture:
Two distinct neural network architectures will be implemented:

#### Deep Neural Network (DNN): 
A comprehensive feedforward neural network, designed to learn intricate patterns and relationships within the KMNIST characters.
#### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):
A specialized network equipped with convolutional layers for spatial feature extraction, catering to the unique visual characteristics of the Japanese characters.
Methodology:

### Data Preprocessing: Normalize the pixel values of the grayscale images to ensure consistency in the model inputs. Additionally, explore data augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization.

### Model Development:

Construct a DNN with multiple hidden layers for feature abstraction.
Implement a CNN tailored to capture spatial hierarchies and intricate patterns in the characters.
### Training and Evaluation:

Train both DNN and CNN models using the KMNIST training dataset.
Evaluate the models on the test dataset to quantify their performance.
Utilize metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for a comprehensive evaluation.
### Comparison and Analysis:

Conduct an in-depth comparative analysis of the performance metrics between the DNN and CNN models.
Examine areas of strength and weakness in each model, providing insights into their suitability for Japanese character recognition.
### Expected Outcomes:
This project aims to contribute valuable insights into the effectiveness of DNNs and CNNs in the recognition of Japanese characters from the Kuzushiji alphabet. The comparative analysis will shed light on the advantages and limitations of each architecture, guiding future endeavors in character recognition and related applications.
